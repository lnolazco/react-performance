# REACT 16 PERFORMANCE

*This is based on my repo: https://github.com/lnolazco/react-boilerplate*

Tests:
- Stateless components
- Stateful components
- Pure components
- Pure component calling a function defined inside the render method
- Pure component calling a function defined out of the render method

## Requirements
Node.js v8

## How to install
- Run `npm install`

## Starting the test performance
- Start the app `npm start`
- Open automatically [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Open console window and check the results.

## Todo
- Add more performance tests.
- Keep internally in a variable the results and add a chart where to display the results (d3).
